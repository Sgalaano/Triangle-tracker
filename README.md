Description
This is a site that I made to show if a triangle is either equilateral, isosceles or scarlene by inputing values in it

Setup/Installation Requirements
run this link:https://github.com/Sgalaano/Triangle-tracker.git

Technologies Used
HTML
Javascript

BUGGS
No bugs at the moment.

B.D.D
Behaviour: The Triangle-Tracker App give the answers to you as you enter the values where if you enter 6,6,6 you will get an equilateral triangle

OUTPUT EXAMPLE : Length of sides cannot be equal to or less than zero

The Program recognizes lengths that are Equal INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 60 sideB = 60 sideC = 60

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: The Triangle is an EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE

The Program recognizes two lengths that are Equal

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 75 sideB = 75 sideC = 20

OUTPUT EXAMPLET: The Triangle is an ISOSCELES TRIANGLE

The Program recognizes lengths that are unequal

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 50 sideB = 40 sideC = 60

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: The triangle is a SCALENE TRIANGLE

The Program recognizes lengths that do not form a triangle

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 120 sideB = 30 sideC = 40

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: This NOT A TRIANGLE

The Program DOES NOT RECOGNIZE TEXTS

Input : sideA = X sideB = y+x sideC = 90

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: INVALID MEASUREMENTS
